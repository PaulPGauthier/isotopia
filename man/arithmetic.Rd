\description{
Several arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) are implemented
to work with specific isotope value object to allow
shorthand data type conversions and calculations.
Operations are generally only permitted if the two isotope
objects being combined have matching attributes (isotope
name, major isotope, etc.).
}
\details{
\code{intensity+-intensity} allows the addition of
intensity values, the result is a another
\code{\link{intensity}} object

\code{abundance+-abundance} is a shorthand for calculating
the isotopic mass balance of two \code{\link{abundance}}
objects, see \code{\link{mass_balance}} for details

\code{delta+-delta} is a shorthand for calculating the
isotopic mass balance of two \code{\link{delta}} objects,
see \code{\link{mass_balance}} for details, will use the
global \code{\link{exact_mass_balance}} setting for the
calculation

\code{alpha - 1} is a shorthand for converting an alpha
value into an epsilon value. Returns epsilon value in units
depending on globally defined \code{use_permil()}.

\code{alpha*ratio}, \code{alpha*alpha}, \code{alpha*delta}
are a shorthand for fractionating an isotope object with an
alpha fractionation factor, see \code{\link{fractionate}}
for details

\code{delta*delta}, is a shorthand for shifting the
reference frame of the first delta value to that of the
second (requires the compound measured in the second to be
the reference of the first!), see
\code{\link{shift_reference}} for details

\code{intensity/intensity} allows the creation of an
isotope \code{\link{ratio}} object

\code{ratio/ratio} allows the creation of an isotope
\code{\link{alpha}} object (a fractionation factor)

\code{alpha/ alpha} allows the creation of another isotope
\code{\link{alpha}} object but requires that either the
denominator names or numerator names of the two alpha
objects are identical (i.e. they "cancel")

\code{delta/delta} creates a \code{\link{epsilon}}
fractionation factor object that describes the
fractionation factor between the two compounds, requires
the reference name of the two delta values to be identical.
Returns epsilon value in units depending on globally
defined \code{use_permil()}. Works identically for two
epsilon values.
